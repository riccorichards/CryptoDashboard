"Multi-Endpoint Dashboard with Axios and Caching."

text: "Build a dashboard app that fetches data from multiple endpoints using axios.get(). The app should display data from each endpoint in a separate widget on the dashboard. Configure the axios.get() requests to include authentication tokens and any other necessary headers. Use a caching library like axios-cache-adapter to cache API responses and improve performance."
